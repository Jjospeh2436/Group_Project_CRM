# Group_Project_CRM
Bikram was able to do a great job by adding the signup page. He was able to use the css grid to set the different positions for the forms and media links and finally adding the image to the right to finish it off.
Following through I was able to create the landing page and although I could not get it to look as exactly as the original I was pleased to see how close I was able to get. Using the same method as Bikram I was able to use the css grid to positions the containers in the specific spots
and setting the links appropriately.
